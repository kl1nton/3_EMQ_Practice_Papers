	A. Healing by secondary intention with simple dressings
 	B. Primary closure
 	C. Split-thickness skin graft
 	D. Full-thickness skin graft
	E. Local flap
	F. Free flap

### Q1
A 45-year-old man with a grade IIIA open fracture of the tibia with loss of skin, fascia and muscle, and bone exposed over a 4-cm-diameter area mid-shin. No infection present.
#### Answer: D. Full-thickness skin graft - *FALSE* = F. Free flap

### Q2
A 25-year-old woman with an injury to the pulp of the right middle finger, with a loss of approximately 1 cm of tissue. Bone not exposed, no infection present.
#### Answer: E. Local flap - *FALSE* = A. Healing by secondary intention with simple dressings

### Q3
A 29-year-old woman undergoing mastectomy for breast cancer, wishing to have a primary reconstruction.
#### Answer: F. Free flap - *FALSE* = E. Local flap

### Q4
A 50-year-old man with a scalp laceration with an area of skin loss and fascia, down to bone, approximately 2 cm in diameter. No infection.
#### Answer: E. Local flap - TRUE

### Q5
Coverage of a 10-cm-diameter area of burns.
#### Answer: C. Split-thickness skin graft - TRUE

### Q6
A 35-year-old man with a degloving injury to the right arm, approximately 6 cm in extent, with the deep fascia still intact. No infection.
#### Answer: B. Primary closure - *FALSE* = C. Split-thickness skin graft

#### Notes
- Healing by secondary intention with simple dressings is very useful in areas where there is an abundant blood supply, eg the pulp of the finger, and when the wound is small enough and not too deep.

- Primary closure is reserved for clean wounds with sufficient margins to be closed without tension; this can be made possible by some undermining of the skin edge.

- Split-skin grafting can be used for more extensive wounds and for deeper wounds, but cannot be used to cover exposed bone, cartilage or tendon. It is very useful in burns to cover the defect and prevent further fluid loss. It can be expanded to cover larger defects using mesh.

- Full-thickness skin grafting can be used on exposed tendon, but is not good for exposed bone or cartilage.
 
- Local flaps provide their own blood supply and can transfer skin, fascia, muscle and bone if required. They are very useful in areas where the skin is specialised for its function, eg fingers, scalp.
 
- Free flaps also provide their own blood supply and can be used when no local flap is available.

- Undescended testes have a 20–30-fold greater incidence of developing a tumour
- In those who have a previous diagnosis of testicular cancer
	- Remaining undescended testis should be biopsied

### Q14
A 35-year-old man develops a hard right testicular mass. He undergoes orchidectomy, which shows it to be a seminoma. A staging CT scan shows lymph node spread above and below the diaphragm.
#### Answer: B. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy - TRUE

### Q26
A 72-year-old man has history of atrial fibrillation but not of peripheral vascular disease or claudication pain. He presents to A&E with a 2-hour history of an acutely ischaemic left leg. Angiography shows a blockage at the origin of the left femoral artery.
#### Answer: B. Angioplasty - *FALSE* = C. Embolectomy
- Hx of limb ischaemia with no previous chronic symptoms, together with a history of atrial fibrillation, is suggestive of an embolus being the cause of the occlusion
- As the Hx is quite short, embolectomy should be carried out

### Q27
An 84-year-old woman, who lives alone, presents with a 36-hour history of acute ischaemia of right foot. Angiography shows occlusion of the right superficial femoral artery.
#### Answer: C. Embolectomy - *FALSE* = A. Amputation
- Prolonged Hx of ischaemia means that reperfusion of the limb is hazardous
	- Can lead to reperfusion injury, which can result in 
		- pulmonary oedema
		- acute respiratory distress syndrome
		- renal failure
		- myocardial dysfunction
- In such cases amputation is often the safest option

### Q28
A 64-year-old man, a heavy smoker, has a history of intermittent claudication affecting the right calf. He presents with an acutely ischaemic right leg. On examination the limb is found to be insensate. Angiography shows occlusion of the right femoral artery with good distal run-off.
#### Answer: F. Thrombolysis - *FALSE* = E. Reconstruction
- Acute on chronic ischaemia is usually secondary to
	- Thrombus formation on the surface of an atheromatous plaque
- If sensory or motor deficit is present and run-off is good
	- Reconstructive operation is advised

### Q29
A 70-year-old woman has a history of acute on chronic ischaemic right leg. This was treated initially with thrombolysis, which *failed*. An angiogram shows occlusion of the superficial femoral artery with poor distal run-off.
#### Answer: E. Reconstruction - *FALSE* = A. Amputation
- If run-off is poor (with or without thrombus), amputation is recommended
- If there is no motor or sensory deficit
	- Thrombolysis is indicated as long as there are *no contraindications*
- Failed thrombolysis + angiogram with poor run-off => preform amputation

- Thyroglossal cysts are remnants of the thyroglossal duct
	- which runs from back of tongue to and including middle third of hyoid bone
- Midline structures differentiated from thyroid swellings by the fact that 
	- they move on protrusion of the tongue

### Q31
A 2-year-old boy presents with unilateral painless swelling at the *base of the neck*. It *brilliantly transilluminates*.
#### Answer: A. Branchial cyst - *FALSE* = B. Cystic hygroma

### Q36
A 15-year-old boy with a history of ulcerative colitis for 5 years has a 2-year history of severe disease, resulting in weight loss and growth failure. He is commenced on increasing doses of steroids without success. Disease is present from transverse colon to rectum.
#### Answer: G. Subtotal colectomy + ileostomy + mucous fistula - *FALSE* = D. Proctocolectomy and ileo-anal pouch
- Ulcerative colitis: 
	1. Restricted to large bowel
	2. Always continuous with a diseased rectum
- Traditional approach to eliminate all disease and remove the risk of developing a malignancy is a proctocolectomy and ileostomy formation
- In a younger patient, for whom a permanent stoma is unacceptable
	- Alternative is to form a ‘pouch’ from ileum and anastomose this to dentate line 
- When rectum is **not** involved
	- Colectomy and ileo-rectal anastomosis avoids a stoma

### Q37
A 39-year-old gentleman with ulcerative colitis presents with a severe acute exacerbation. Three days after admission he develops severe abdominal pain, becomes septic, and on examination has a rigid abdomen with peritonism. Erect chest X-ray shows air under the diaphragm.
#### Answer: E. Proctocolectomy and ileostomy - *FALSE* = G. Subtotal colectomy + ileostomy + mucous fistula
- Emergency surgery in ulcerative colitis, eg to treat a perforation
	- Usually managed with subtotal colectomy, ileostomy and mucous fistula
- Leaves an intact rectum and anal sphincter for restorative surgery in future

### Q38
A 27-year-old woman with Crohn's disease is admitted for the fourth occasion in 6 months with small-bowel obstruction. Barium follow-through shows a 4-cm stricture of the proximal ileum.
#### Answer: F. Stricturoplasty - TRUE
- Bowel-preserving technique in which 
	1. inflammatory strictures are incised longitudinally, and
	2. then sutured transversely, thus widening the bowel wall

### Q39
A 22-year-old woman with diagnosis of Crohn's disease has a history over the past year of recurrent anaemia and weight loss. Colonoscopy shows severe inflammation and active disease affecting the caecum and terminal ileum. Maximum medical therapy has been unsuccessful.
#### Answer: C. Ileo-caecal resection - TRUE
- Crohn's disease surgery differs from management of ulcerative colitis (UC)
	- Purpose is to preserve as much bowel length as possible
- Due to its relapsing and remitting nature and tendency to affect any part of GIT 	
	- No surgery can be considered curative

### Q40
A 21-year-old patient with a history of severe ulcerative colitis has failed on medical treatment alone. Investigations show rectal sparing.
#### Answer: A. Colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis - TRUE
- Used in both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis to avoid an ileostomy
- 33% of patients have a good result and 33% have a poor result
	- Usually due to recurrent disease

It is not possible to feel the right testicle separately from the swelling, but it is possible to get above it and feel the cord as a separate structure.
#### Answer: B. Encysted hydrocoele of the cord - *FALSE* = F. Hydrocoele
- A hydrocoele is an abnormal collection of fluid within the tunica vaginalis
- It can be primary or secondary to a disease process such as infection or carcinoma
- It is fluctuant, transilluminable and it is impossibe to feel the testis as a separate structure

### Q42
A 65-year-old man presents with a slowly enlarging painless scrotal swelling. On examination it is fluctuant and transilluminates. It is possible to get above it on examination and feel the testis as a separate structure. The swelling is found to lie above and slightly behind the testis.
#### Answer: C. Epididymal cyst - TRUE
- An epididymal cyst is a fluid-filled swelling connected with the epididymis which is usually painless
- It is fluctuant, transilluminable and felt separate to both the testis and the cord structures
- It lies above and slightly behind the testis

### Q43
A 70-year-old man has a history of a long-standing ‘aching’ sensation in the right testis. On examination he has a firm craggy mass and a few discharging sinuses on the scrotal skin. Urine microscopy shows sterile pyuria.
#### Answer: D. Chronic epididymo-orchitis - TRUE
- Chronic epididymo-orchitis is most commonly due to TB but can also be caused by sarcoidosis and unresolved acute epididymo-orchitis
- Usually presents as a painless hard nodule and can be associated with
	- Hydrocoele or ulceration and sinus formation on the scrotal skin
- It may be treated with standard anti-tuberculosis medication

### Q44

#### Answer: G. Inguino-scrotal hernia - *FALSE* = J. Varicocele
- A varicocele is ‘varicose veins of the spermatic cord’ and is due to dilatation of the veins in the pampiniform plexus
- It is usually asymptomatic can cause a dragging, aching pain
- It is soft, irregularly shaped and non-transilluminable and disappears on lying down
- Sudden appearance of a varicocele in older men should alert you to the possibility of retroperitoneal disease

### Q45
A 45-year-old man presents with a right-sided scrotal swelling which increases in size on standing up. On examination it is not transilluminable and it is not possible to get above it. There is a positive cough impulse.
#### Answer: G. Inguino-scrotal hernia - TRUE
- Inguino-scrotal hernias are those which descend into the scrotum and are most commonly of the indirect type
- They are soft, reducible and nontransilluminable and it is impossible to get above them 	
	- although possible to feel the testis as a separate structure
- A cough impulse is present. 

### Q46
A 25-year-old man presents with a smooth, left-sided, painless scrotal swelling which is transilluminable and fluctuant. It is possible to feel the testis as a separate structure below the swelling.
#### Answer: F. Hydrocoele - *FALSE* = B. Encysted hydrocoele of the cord
- An encysted hydrocoele of the cord is a fluid-fiIled structure which can lie at any point between the inguinal ring and the upper scrotum
- It is fluctuant and transilluminable and it is possible to feel the testis as a separate structure.


Q47-50: Theme: Upper Limb Fractures
-----------------------------------

	A. Barton's fracture
	B. Bennett's fracture
	C. Colles’ fracture
	D. Galeazzi's fracture
	E. Monteggia's fracture
	F. Smith's fracture

### Q47
A 24-year-old woman presents with a painful left arm following an RTA. The X-ray shows a fracture of the upper third of the ulna together with an associated dislocated radial head.
#### Answer: E. Monteggia's fracture - TRUE

### Q48
An 84-year-old woman has a fall in the street, landing on her right hand, which appears swollen and deformed. An X-ray shows a fracture of the distal radius, which is angulated dorsally. The fracture extends intra-articularly and there is subluxation of the carpus.
#### Answer: C. Colles’ fracture - *FALSE* = A. Barton's fracture

### Q49
A 76-year-old woman stumbles down the stairs at home, landing heavily on her left arm. On examination she has a deformed, bruised left wrist. An X-ray shows an extra-articular fracture of the distal radius, which is displaced volarly.
#### Answer: F. Smith's fracture - TRUE

### Q50
A 15-year-old boy is knocked off his bicycle and lands on his right arm. He presents to A&E with a swollen tender wrist. An X-ray shows a fracture of the mid-shaft of the radius and dislocation of the inferior radio-ulnar joint.
#### Answer: D. Galeazzi's fracture - TRUE

#### Notes

##### Monteggia's, Galeazzi's
- Monteggia's and Galeazzi's fractures: forearm fractures associated with a dislocation
- Monteggia's fracture is a fracture of the upper third of the ulna together with a dislocated radial head
- Galeazzi's fracture is a fracture of the shaft of the radius together with a dislocation of the inferior radio-ulnar joint

##### Smith's, Colles', Barton
- Smith's and Colles’ fractures are both extra-articular fractures of the distal radius, but 
in Smith's fracture there is volar displacement of the distal fragment whereas in Colles’ fracture there is dorsal and radial displacement
- By definition, Colles’ fracture must occur within 2.5 cm of the wrist joint
- Barton's fracture is an intra-articular fracture of the distal radius associated with subluxation of the carpus.


Q51-53: Theme: Staging of Colon Cancer
--------------------------------------

	A. Duke's A stage
	B. Duke's B stage
	C. Duke's C stage
	D. Duke's D stage

### Q51
A 68-year-old man presents with weight loss and iron-deficiency anaemia. Colonoscopy confirms a caecal mass. The specimen obtained at laparotomy shows adenocarcinoma extending through the bowel wall. All of the nine lymph nodes removed are involved.
#### Answer: D. Duke's D stage - *FALSE* = C. Duke's C stage

### Q52
A 52-year-old man presents with a history of increasingly severe constipation and rectal bleeding. He is found to have a stenosing lesion of the distal sigmoid colon. Biopsy confirms adenocarcinoma. He undergoes anterior resection and the specimen shows three out of the total seven nodes removed are involved.
#### Answer: C. Duke's C stage - TRUE

### Q53
A 25-year-old man from a family known to carry the HNPCC gene is found to have a lesion in the transverse colon at colonoscopy. Resection and histological examination of the specimen shows this to be invading the muscle layer of the bowel wall.
#### Answer: B. Duke's B stage - *FALSE* = A. Duke's A stage

#### Notes
- Colorectal cancers are staged primarily on the pathological features of the resected specimen using Duke's system
- Clinical staging takes account of whether the resection margin is involved

##### Duke's Staging of Colorectal Cancer (related to 5-yr survival rate)
- A = Confined to bowel wall
- B = Spread through bowel wall but no nodes involved
- C = Lymph node involvement
	- Stage C is often divided into 
		- stage C1 (highest node not involved) and 
		- stage C2 (highest node involved)
- D = Distant metastases
	- Stage D was not included in the original staging but is often use


Q54-56: Theme: Urinary System Trauma
------------------------------------

	A. Catheterisation and contrast
	B. CT scan
	C. Cystogram
	D. Retrograde uteropyelography
	E. Surgical exploration
	F. Urethrogram
 
### Q54
A 25-year-old man slips while walking along the top of a metal gate and falls, straddling the gate. On examination he is in significant pain and has butterfly pattern bruising to the perineum. There is fresh blood at the urethral meatus.
#### Answer: F. Urethrogram - TRUE
- Blood at the urethral meatus is a strong indicator of urethral rupture
- In these circumstances, catheterisation is contraindicated
- Urethrography should be performed using water-soluble contrast to demonstrate any leaks and if injury is confirmed, a suprapubic catheter should be sited
- Formal urethral repair should be delayed for 3–6 months

### Q55
A 30-year-old man involved in a fight sustains a blow to the groin with a blunt instrument. On examination there is gross swelling and bruising with an area of tense swelling around the left testicle, which is becoming increasingly large and painful.
#### Answer: E. Surgical exploration - TRUE
- If an injury is sustained to the suprapubic region and bladder trauma is suspected, cystography should be carried out as long as there is no blood at the meatus
- Testicular trauma often results in haematoma formation
- If this is small with no evidence of testicular rupture, it can be managed conservatively
- If the haematoma is large, increasingly painful or there is evidence of testicular rupture, surgical exploration and evacuation of haematoma is required

### Q56
A 52-year-old man is mugged and stabbed with a knife in the area of the left renal angle. He complains of loin pain. Dipstick shows microscopic haematuria.
#### Answer: D. Retrograde uteropyelography - *FALSE* = B. CT scan
- Renal trauma is most commonly blunt
- In penetrating injuries or those due to rib fractures, associated injuries should be looked for
- All such injuries should be investigated by CT scan or high-dose IVU


Q57-59: Theme: Preparation of Patients for Endocrine Surgery
------------------------------------------------------------

	A. Bowel preparation
	B. Calcitonin infusion
	C. Corticosteroids
	D. Phenoxybenzamine and propranolol
	E. Thallium technetium scan
	F. Thyroxine
	G. Vocal cord examination

### Q57
A 28-year-old woman with Graves’ disease resistant to medical treatment is due to have a subtotal thyroidectomy for symptoms of compression.
#### Answer: E. Thallium technetium scan - *FALSE* = G. Vocal cord examination
- Patients due to undergo thyroidectomy require vocal cord examination as there is a risk of nerve damage during the operation
- They should also be rendered euthyroid to prevent a ‘thyroid storm’ occurring when the thyroid is handled

### Q58
A 42-year-old patient is planned to have a *parathyroidectomy* after presenting with raised calcium and parathyroid hormone levels with no history of renal disease.
#### Answer: B. Calcitonin infusion - *FALSE* = E. Thallium technetium scan
- Parathyroidectomy should be preceded by a technetium scan
- Although 80% of primary hyperparathyroidism cases are due to a single adenoma
	- 10–15% have hyperplasia, and
	- 2% have two adenomas
- All four parathyroids therefore need to be located
	- they can occur in a variety of positions from hyoid bone to mediastinum

### Q59
A 34-year-old patient is found to have bilateral adrenal masses on CT, and suspected to have phaeochromocytoma. An adrenalectomy is planned.
#### Answer: C. Corticosteroids - *FALSE* = D. Phenoxybenzamine and propranolol
- Patients due to undergo adrenalectomy must be thoroughly prepared with α- and β-adrenergic blockade using phenoxybenzamine and propranolol, respectively, 
- Potentially fatal changes in cardiovascular system can occur under anaesthesia and while handling the tumour.


Q60-62: Theme: Management of Paediatric Disorders
-------------------------------------------------

	A. Broad-spectrum antibiotics
	B. Gastrografin enema
	C. Laparotomy and duodenostomy
	D. Laparotomy and proceed
	E. Pneumatic reduction
	F. Ramstedt's pyloromyotomy

### Q60
A 40-day-old baby develops projectile vomiting approximately 20 minutes after each feed together with failure to thrive. On examination an olive-shaped mass is noted in the RUQ following feeding. Bloods show a metabolic alkalosis.
#### Answer: F. Ramstedt's pyloromyotomy - TRUE
- The baby has typical presenting features of pyloric stenosis secondary to hypertrophy of the circular pyloric muscles. Aetiology is unknown. It is diagnosed by carrying out a test feed and ultrasound scan. Patients should be adequately hydrated and electrolytes corrected prior to surgery.

### Q61
A 2-day-old baby known to have cystic fibrosis presents with a distended abdomen and bilious vomiting. His rectum is empty.
#### Answer: B. Gastrografin enema - TRUE
- The scenario suggests meconium ileus, which is found in 15% of babies with cystic fibrosis due to highly concentrated meconium which obstructs the terminal ileum pre-natally. This can be diagnosed pre-natally by ultrasound scan. Gastrografin enema can be therapeutic in an uncomplicated case due to its detergent-like effect, which loosens the meconium. However, the baby should also be prepared for laparotomy.

### Q62
A 1-year-old infant presents with intermittent spasms of abdominal pain associated with drawing up of the legs and a small amount of rectal bleeding. A sausage-shaped mass is noted in the epigastrium. Two similar episodes in the past were treated with hydrostatic reduction.
#### Answer: D. Laparotomy and proceed - TRUE
- The history is typical of intussusception. First-line treatment is hydrostatic or pneumatic reduction if there no evidence of peritonitis and if it is less than 24 hours since onset. However, if recurrent, laparotomy is indicated to identify a precipitating cause, eg Meckel's diverticulum or a polyp.


Q63-69: Theme: Renal Stones
---------------------------

	A. Watch and wait
	B. Extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL)
	C. Flexible ureteroscopy
	D. Rigid ureteroscopy
	E. Laparoscopic ureterolithotomy
	F. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL)
	G. Nephrectomy

### Q63
A 54-year-old woman with a history of renal stone disease presents with a 2-month history of intermittent left loin pain. An intravenous urogram (IVU) shows a 1.5-cm stone in the left renal pelvis but no evidence of obstruction. She has a past history of ischaemic heart disease and has a 4-cm **aortic aneurysm** lying close to the origin of the left renal artery; this is under surveillance.
#### Answer: B. Extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) - *FALSE* = F. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL)
- Stones < 2 cm in the kidney or ureter are generally treated with ESWL
- However, this is contraindicated in pregnancy or in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) which lie in the blast path
	- In such patients PCNL is a better option
- This is also the preferred option for 
	- stones > 2 cm or 
	- stones > 1 cm in lower pole region, as they have poor clearance rates

### Q64
A 27-year-old man presents to A&E with severe right loin and groin pain and microscopic haematuria on dipstick. Pain is well controlled with NSAIDs and pethidine. An IVU confirms the presence of a 4-mm stone in the right mid-ureter region.
#### Answer: A. Watch and wait - TRUE

### Q65
A 42-year-old man presents to A&E with severe right loin pain radiating to the groin. He is sweating profusely and vomiting, with a temperature of 38.9°C. Dipstick shows 3+ blood and 3+ leucocytes. An IVU shows a 5-mm stone in the upper right ureter and dilated calyces.
#### Answer: E. Laparoscopic ureterolithotomy - *FALSE* = B. Extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL)
- See A63

### Q66
A 24-year-old woman develops severe loin pain with one episode of frank haematuria. She is apyrexial. An IVU shows a 1-cm calculus lying in the lower pole of the right kidney.
#### Answer: F. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) - TRUE
- Nephrectomy is the preferred option for treatment of renal calculi if the affected kidney has a differential function of < 15% (with normal global renal function)
- The presence of infection in an upper urinary tract obstructed by stone is dangerous and is an indication for urgent surgical intervention irrespective of the size of the stone

### Q67
An asymptomatic 29-year-old woman undergoes an ultrasound scan which reveals a 1-cm renal calculus within a cyst.
#### Answer: A. Watch and wait - TRUE
- Indications for conservative treatment of renal calculi include 
	- Calculi less than 5 mm diameter
	- Medullary sponge kidney
	- Calculi within cysts

### Q68
A 35-year-old man with right loin to groin pain, who is apyrexial, has a 5-mm calculus in the proximal ureter on IVU.
#### Answer: C. Flexible ureteroscopy - *FALSE* = E. Laparoscopic ureterolithotomy
- This is a large stone load
	- Location of the calculus would require multiple treatments with ESWL
- Laparoscopic ureterolithotomy allows this to be dealt with in single procedure

### Q69
A 53-year-old man presents with left loin to groin pain and haematuria. IVU reveals a 1-cm calculus in the *lower pole* of the right kidney.
#### Answer: F. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) - *FALSE* = C. Flexible ureteroscopy
- Lower pole of the kidney is unfavourable anatomy for ESWL
	- Flexible ureteroscopy is superior


Q70-73: Theme: Management of Thyroid Cancer
-------------------------------------------

	A. Chemotherapy alone
	B. Lobectomy
	C. Subtotal thyroidectomy
	D. Surgery and external beam radiotherapy
	E. Total thyroidectomy and thyroxine replacement

### Q70
A 27-year-old man with history of previous neck irradiation for lymphoma presents with thyroid mass. Fine-needle aspiration reveals cells with 'orphan Annie' nuclei. CT shows localised disease.
#### Answer: C. Subtotal thyroidectomy - *FALSE* = E. Total thyroidectomy and thyroxine replacement
- Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid is often seen in younger patients with a history of irradiation to the neck
- Histological examination shows pale, empty-looking nuclei – so-called ‘orphan Annie’ nuclei
- The 10-year survival rate is 90%.

### Q71
A 90-year-old woman presents with a hard thyroid mass and a progressively hoarse voice. Cervical lymph nodes are hard and enlarged.
#### Answer: D. Surgery and external beam radiotherapy - TRUE
- Elderly patients are more likely to develop anaplastic carcinomas
	- which have a very poor prognosis despite Tx with surgery and radiotherapy.

### Q72
A 48-year-old patient with a family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndrome presents with a thyroid mass that appears malignant but shows no evidence of spread.
#### Answer: E. Total thyroidectomy and thyroxine replacement - TRUE
- Medullary carcinomas of the thyroid are tumours of C-cells 
	- which produce calcitonin and are associated with familial MEN syndrome

### Q73
A 57-year-old woman presents with painless thyroid swelling and weight loss. Fine-needle aspiration of the swelling indicates that it is a lymphoma.
#### Answer: E. Total thyroidectomy and thyroxine replacement - *FALSE* = D. Surgery and external beam radiotherapy
- Lymphoma of the thyroid is treated in a similar way to anaplastic carcinoma 
	- but has better results


Q74-77: Theme: Pruritus Ani
---------------------------

	A. Anal carcinoma
	B. Anal fissure
	C. Anal polyp
	D. Fistula in ano
	E. Gonorrhoea

	G. Syphilis
	H. Yeast infection

### Q74
A 35-year-old woman who regularly takes codeine-based analgesics for tension headaches presents with pruritus ani, rectal bleeding and severe pain following defecation.
#### Answer: F. Haemorrhoids - *FALSE* = B. Anal fissure
- Constipated patients (eg due to opioid-based analgesia) can develop anal fissures – longitudinal tears of the lower half of the anal canal. Although haemorrhoids can also present in this way they are infrequently associated with severe pain unless thrombosed. The pain associated with anal fissures can last for 1–2 hours following defecation.

### Q75
A 57-year-old HIV-positive man has a history of long-standing anal intra-epithelial neoplasia (AIN) but was lost to follow-up for the past 5 years. He now presents with pruritus ani and a firm ulcerated mass at the anal margin with palpable lymph nodes.
#### Answer: A. Anal carcinoma - TRUE
- Anal carcinoma is more common in homosexuals with a history of anal or genital warts and presents with bleeding, pain, swelling or ulceration and may be associated with enlarged inguinal lymph nodes. Diagnosis should be confirmed with examination under anaesthetic (EUA) and biopsy. Syphilis can present in a similar way but more usually as an shallow ulcer (chancre) rather than a mass.

### Q76
A 25-year-old woman with a history of ulcerative colitis on maximum medical therapy to help control disease presents with pruritus ani. On examination the peri-anal area is red, inflamed and excoriated with a well-demarcated edge.
#### Answer: B. Anal fissure - *FALSE* = H. Yeast infection
- Steroids and other immunosuppressants are used in the medical management of ulcerative colitis and they predispose patients to developing opportunistic yeast overgrowth. Candidal infections affecting the skin usually cause areas of erythema with a well-demarcated edge.

### Q77
A 48-year-old man presents with a 3-month history of weight loss and intermittent fever. He also complains of itching around the anus, associated with soreness and purulent discharge.
#### Answer: D. Fistula in ano - TRUE

- There is discharge of pus from the external opening


Q78-81: Theme: Management of Venous Disease of the Lower Limb
-------------------------------------------------------------

	A. Debridement and compression bandaging
	B. Elevation and NSAIDs
	C. Injection sclerotherapy
	D. Sapheno-femoral ligation
	E. Split-skin graft
	F. Stab avulsions
	G. Systemic antibiotics
	H. Topical antibiotics

### Q78
A 46-year-old woman has long-standing varicose veins affecting both legs which have recently started to ache. Doppler examination shows no problem with the deep venous system. Varicosities are in the distribution of the long saphenous vein.
#### Answer: D. Sapheno-femoral ligation - TRUE
- Superficial varicosities can be treated conservatively with support stockings but if increasingly symptomatic (or if patient wishes for cosmetic reasons) surgery is indicated. Long and short saphenous vein incompetences are treated by sapheno-femoral and sapheno-popliteal ligation respectively. Branch varicosities can be treated by stab avulsions.

### Q79
A 69-year-old woman has a history of deep vein thrombosis affecting the right leg 20 years ago. She now presents with longstanding ulcers over the right gaiter region. ABPI of both legs = 0.8. She is treated with debridement and compression dressing, but review at 12 weeks shows no improvement.
#### Answer: B. Elevation and NSAIDs - *FALSE* = E. Split-skin graft
- Debridement and compression bandaging is the usual first-line treatment for venous ulcers, as long as the ABPI is greater than 0.5. Failure to heal after 12 weeks of this treatment is an indication for split-skin grafting, as are ulcers greater than 10 cm2 in size.

### Q80
An 84-year-old woman with a long-standing venous ulcer of the left shin, treated with regular debridement and dressings, notices it is becoming increasingly tender. On examination the ulcer has a small amount of purulent, offensive discharge and there is surrounding cellulitis.
#### Answer: G. Systemic antibiotics - TRUE
- Infected ulcers should be managed by taking a swab for culture followed by regular cleaning and dressing – topical antibiotics should be avoided. Surrounding cellulitis, however, is an indication for intravenous antibiotics.

### Q81
A 60-year-old woman with a 10-year history of varicose veins affecting both legs presents with an acute episode of painful *thrombophlebitis*.
#### Answer: H. Topical antibiotics - *FALSE* = B. Elevation and NSAIDs
- Thrombophlebitis is best managed with elevation, NSAIDs and support stockings.

	1. Umbilicus (Cullen's sign)
	2. Flanks (Grey Turner's sign)
- Due to haemorrhagic pancreatitis with retroperitoneal spread of blood

### Q84
A 45-year-old woman with known gallstones presents with RUQ pain and fever and is found to have a raised WCC. On palpation of the abdomen she is found to be tender in the RUQ and this increases when she breathes in, such that it causes her to stop inspiring.
#### Answer: E. Murphy's sign - TRUE
- Murphy's sign is seen in acute cholecystitis and should not be able to be reproduced in the left upper quadrant
- It is caused by the downward movement of the inflamed gallbladder onto the examining hand during examination
- Boas’ sign is also seen in acute cholecystitis - TODO

### Q85
A 27-year-old man presents with right iliac fossa (RIF) pain, preceded by 2 days of generalised abdominal pain and associated vomiting. His WCC is raised. Palpation in the left iliac fossa (LIF) reproduces the pain in the RIF.
#### Answer: G. Rovsing's sign - TRUE
- Rovsing's sign is seen in acute appendicitis
	- palpation in LIF reproduces pain in RIF 
		- due to movement of inflamed parietal peritoneum

- Pfannenstiel's incision provides excellent access for gynaecological procedures as well as bladder and prostate operations
- It can also be used for bilateral hernia repair
- In *emergency setting*, e.g. suspected torted ovarian cyst
	- Midline incision may be more appropriate

### Q87
A 38-year-old alcoholic presents with severe epigastric pain. Examination reveals a rigid abdomen and no bowel sounds. Erect chest X-ray shows air under the diaphragm.
#### Answer: D. Laparoscopic port incision - *FALSE* = E. (*Upper*) Midline incision
- A perforated duodenal ulcer requires access for oversewing and washout
	- An (upper) midline incision is appropriate

### Q88
A 38-year-old woman who is in the second trimester of pregnancy has had multiple episodes of cholecystitis in recent months which are becoming increasingly frequent. She is to have cholecystectomy as soon as possible.
#### Answer: B. Kocher's incision - TRUE
- Kocher's incision is a good incision for 
	1. Left: cholecystectomy, and 
	2. Right: splenectomy
- **NOTE** Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is contraindicated in pregnancy

### Q89
A 16-year-old girl presents with central abdominal pain which shifts to the right iliac fossa and is associated with nausea and diarrhoea. She has a low-grade temperature and WCC of 18 × 10^9/l. Examination reveals rebound tenderness and guarding in the RIF.
#### Answer: C. Lanz incision - TRUE
- Access for appendicitis can be via a gridiron or Lanz incision
- Lanz's incision is more appropriate in a young woman
	- It is lower and has a better cosmetic result

### Q90
A 48-year-old woman admitted for curative surgery for carcinoma of the head of the pancreas.
#### Answer: I. Rutherford–Morrison incision - *FALSE* = H. Rooftop incision

### Q92
A 67-year-old chronic alcoholic.
#### Answer: A | 10.0 | 120 | 9.0 | 6.0 | 0.1 | 300 - TRUE
- Alcoholics are prone to developing *megaloblastic anaemia* (low Hb, high MCV)
- This occurs when there is defective synthesis of DNA and delayed mitoses
	- resulting in a nuclear-cytoplasmic asynchrony
- It is usually due to vitamin B12 or folate deficiency

#### Answer: E | 22.0 | 87 | 5.0 | 2.5 | 0.3 | 350 - TRUE
- Polycythaemia rubra vera is a myeloproliferative syndrome which causes increased amounts of erythroid precursors with increased red cell mass
- Haematocrit and blood viscosity are also raised
	- Increasing the risk of DVT in these individuals


Q97-99: Theme: Salivary Glands
------------------------------

	A. Parotid gland
	B. Sublingual gland
	C. Submandibular gland

### Q97
The facial nerve runs through this gland and its blood supply comes from a branch of the external carotid artery. Of tumours arising in this gland, 80% are benign.
#### Answer: A. Parotid gland - TRUE
- The parotid gland lies behind the mastoid process, styloid process and ramus of the mandible and has the facial nerve, retromandibular vein, external carotid artery and auriculotemporal nerve running through it
- The parotid duct pierces the buccinator muscle to drain opposite the second upper molar

### Q98
This gland secretes mucous and serous saliva. Secretomotor fibres come from the parasympathetic system which hitch-hike along with the chorda tympani and lingual nerve.
#### Answer: B. Sublingual gland - *FALSE* = C. Submandibular gland
- Submandibular is a *mixed salivary gland* secreting mucous and serous saliva 
	- Duct enters the floor of the mouth next to the frenulum of Tongue
- Sublingual lies in front of anterior border of hyoglossus, medial to genioglossus
	It is a *mucus-secreting gland* and is supplied by lingual artery

### Q99
This gland is divided into deep and superficial parts by the posterior border of the myohyoid muscle. Blood supply comes from the facial artery and vein.
#### Answer: A. Parotid gland - *FALSE* = C. Submandibular gland
- See A98

Q100-105: Theme: Management of Hernias
--------------------------------------

	A. Conservative management
	B. Elective hernia repair
	C. Emergency hernia repair
	D. Urgent hernia repairs, i.e. on an elective list but prioritised over benign conditions

### Q100
A 79-year-old woman presents to clinic with a small (3 cm) non-tender lump in her groin. It has been present for the past 2 months. It lies *below and lateral* to the pubic tubercle. It is irreducible and there is no cough impulse.
#### Answer: D. Urgent hernia repairs, i.e. on an elective list but prioritised over benign conditions - TRUE
- This is a femoral hernia, and as such is likely to strangulate
- As there is no evidence of strangulation at present, it does not have to be treated as an emergency, but should be treated as a priority

### Q101
A *1-year-old boy* presents with a small *indirect inguinal* hernia.
#### Answer: C. Emergency hernia repair - *FALSE* = D. Urgent hernia repairs, i.e. on an elective list but prioritised over benign conditions
- Inguinal hernias in children do not necessarily cause strangulated bowel
	- but an incarcerated inguinal hernia is likely to produce testicular ischaemia
- Hence it does not have to be repaired as an emergency, as there are no acute problems, but it should be done urgently

### Q102
A 65-year-old man presents with an indirect inguinal hernia. It is non-tender and has been present for 3 weeks. It initially reduced spontaneously, but over the past 2 days it has not been reducible.
#### Answer: B. Elective hernia repair - *FALSE* = D. Urgent hernia repairs, i.e. on an elective list but prioritised over benign conditions
- The short duration of this hernia and the fact that it has become irreducible in such a short time-span mean that repairing this hernia should be a priority
- Again there are no signs suggestive of strangulation and so an emergency operation is not necessary

### Q103
An 84-year-old man with chronic bronchitis, diabetes mellitus and a past medical history of two episodes of myocardial infarction presents with an inguinal hernia. It has been present for 7 years, but for the past day it has been very painful and irreducible. On examination it is tender and erythematous and there is no cough impulse.
#### Answer: C. Emergency hernia repair - TRUE
- This hernia is showing signs of strangulation – it is *red, hot and irreducible* 
- Irrespective of the patient's medical condition, this hernia requires emergency repair 
	- One option might be to attempt to repair it under local anaesthesia

### Q104
A healthy 84-year-old man presents to clinic with a small right inguinal hernia. On examination there is a 2-cm-diameter direct hernia which is palpable only on coughing.
#### Answer: B. Elective hernia repair - *FALSE* = A. Conservative management
- This is a small, direct, easily reducible hernia
	It is at very low risk of strangulation
- It can be treated conservatively as it does not seem to be bothering the patient
	- This decision can be changed should the hernia enlarge or become symptomatic

### Q105
A 20-year-old man presents with a painless, reducible lump in the right groin, above and medial to the pubic tubercle, extending into the scrotum, which can be controlled with occlusion of the deep inguinal ring.
#### Answer: B. Elective hernia repair - TRUE
- The site of this hernia and the fact that it can be controlled by occluding the deep inguinal ring reveal it to be an indirect inguinal hernia
- These extend into the groin more commonly than other hernias
- Asymptomatic indirect inguinal hernias have a low risk of strangulation
	- therefore elective surgery can be performed

### Q110
A 43-year-old man with known parathyroid adenoma presents to A&E with haematemesis.
#### Answer: H. Cystadenoma - *FALSE* = A. Gastrinoma
- Peptic ulceration is a feature of 90% of gastrinomas and 30% of gastrinomas are associated with other endocrine tumours (MEN type I).

### Q111
A 64-year-old woman presents with obstructive jaundice and RUQ pain. A random blood glucose is 15.4 mmol/l and an ultrasound scan of the abdomen reveals gallstones.
#### Answer: B. Glucagonoma - *FALSE* = D. Somatostatinoma (changed correct answer!)
- Somatostatinomas are rare tumours derived from pancreatic delta cells
- Somatostatin 
	- Delays gastric emptying and 
	- Inhibits production of both insulin and glucagons
- Clinical features are steatorrhoea, diabetes mellitus and cholelithiasis

### Q112
A 50-year-old man with a history of weight loss is found to have a mass on his pancreas on CT. He is discovered to be diabetic. He also has a persistent eczematous rash on his buttocks which has been present for over a year.
#### Answer: C. Insulinoma - *FALSE* = B. Glucagonoma
- Glucagonomas are tumours of the pancreatic alpha cells
- They are rare and can present with an eczematous rash, glossitis, stomatitis, diabetes and weight loss (due to increased gluconeogenesis).

### Q113
A 40-year-old woman presents with a 1-year history of epigastric pain. She is prompted to visit A&E following an episode of melaena. Endoscopy reveals multiple peptic ulcers. A CT scan shows tumours affecting the pancreas and duodenum.
#### Answer: F. Carcinoma - *FALSE* = I. Zollinger–Ellison tumour
- Zollinger–Ellison tumours are rare and affect the non-beta cells of the pancreatic islets of Langerhans
- In 90% of cases they present with peptic ulceration; 30% are associated with other endocrine tumours (MEN I).

### Q114
A 28-year-old man is taken to his GP by his partner, who says he has been behaving strangely and has had episodes of altered consciousness. This occurs particularly if he skips meals. He has a family history of MEN I.
#### Answer: A. Gastrinoma - *FALSE* = C. Insulinoma
- Insulinomas are tumours of the beta cells of the pancreas and are usually solitary
	- They present with *hyPOglycaemia*

### Q115
A 28-year-old woman presents with a right-sided breast lump. It measures 1 cm in diameter, is mobile, smooth, non-tender, and is superficial to the pectoralis major. There are no associated skin changes. Both axillae are clear. An ultrasound scan is reported as showing a benign lump.
#### Answer: E. No further investigation - *FALSE* = C. Fine-needle aspiration
- Even though the lump is clinically and radiologically benign
	- It is good practice to obtain *Cytological Dx* as part of 'triple assessment'

### Q116
A 55-year-old woman is sent to your clinic after screening mammography reveals a suspicious area in the left breast. Clinical examination does not reveal any suspicious areas.
#### Answer: F. Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration - TRUE
- This woman has a suspicious area on routine mammography
- As the area is impalpable it is not possible to do a fine-needle aspiration in clinic, but part of the further investigation of the patient would be an ultrasound scan, and a fine-needle aspiration should be attempted at the same time.


Q117-121: Theme: Intravenous Fluids
-----------------------------------

	A. 0.45% Sodium chloride solution
	B. 0.9% Sodium chloride solution
	C. 4% Dextrose/0.18% sodium chloride solution
	D. 5% Dextrose solution
	E. Compound sodium lactate solution
	F. Dextran 70

### Q117
Which fluid has been shown to reduce the incidence of deep venous thrombosis?
#### Answer: F. Dextran 70 - TRUE
- Dextran 70 expands the plasma volume, leading to decreased stasis
- It also alters the structure of thrombus to a less organised thrombus, which is supposed to produce smaller, less harmful emboli
- However, it is not often used as there is a high risk of anaphylaxis, and it is not as effective as heparin.

### Q118
Which fluid is recommended in the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) guidelines for the initial resuscitation of the trauma patient?
#### Answer: E. Compound sodium lactate solution - TRUE
- Compound sodium lactate (also known as Ringer's lactate or Hartmann's solution) 
	- is the fluid of choice for initial resuscitation according to ATLS guidelines

### Q119
Which fluid contains 5 mmol of potassium per litre?
#### Answer: E. Compound sodium lactate solution - TRUE
- Compound sodium lactate is the only one of the given fluids to contain potassium
- It also contains 130 mmol sodium, 111 mmol chloride and 29 mmol lactate.

### Q120
Which fluid contains 150 mmol of sodium per litre?
#### Answer: B. 0.9% Sodium chloride solution - TRUE
- 0.9% Sodium chloride solution contains 150 mmol sodium
- 0.45% sodium chloride solution contains 75 mmol sodium
- and 4% dextrose/0.18% sodium chloride contains 30 mmol sodium
- Compound sodium lactate contains 131 mmol sodium

### Q121
Which fluid given in equal volumes expands the *intravascular compartment least*?
#### Answer: D. 5% Dextrose solution - TRUE
- Water tends to follow the sodium ions, so any fluid containing sodium is more likely to remain in the intravascular compartment
- Dextrose in any solution is rapidly metabolised, it is the same as giving water
- This is spread throughout body fluid, i.e. intracellular and extracellular fluid
	- So less remains in the intravascular compartment


Q122-124: Theme: Specific Tests
-------------------------------

	A. Allen's test
	B. Froment's test
	C. Lachman's test
	D. Pivot shift test
	E. Simmonds' test
	F. Tinel's test
	G. Trendelenburg's test

### Q122
A 21-year-old, very anxious footballer presents to the fracture clinic with an acute swelling of the right knee following a twisting injury 2 days ago. There is no bony tenderness around the knee joint. He is able to fully weight-bear, fully extend his knee and flex to 90 degrees. Aspiration confirms a haemarthrosis.
#### Answer: C. Lachman's test - TRUE
- Traumatic haemarthrosis is usually caused by 
	1. Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture
	2. Tibial spine avulsion, or 
	3. Meniscal tears
- The mechanism suggests an ACL injury
- Although the pivot shift test would also identify a torn ACL
	- it is not recommended in clinic with an anxious patient as it can be very painful

### Q123
A 69-year-old woman attends the outpatients clinic. On examination she has guttering in the dorsal aspect of her right hand and apparent wasting of the muscles of the hand.
#### Answer: F. Tinel's test - *FALSE* = B. Froment's test
- Froment's test involves asking the patient to hold a piece of paper between the index finger and an adducted thumb
- The clinician pulls the paper away
- If an ulnar nerve palsy is present, the patient will be unable to adduct the thumb due to paralysis of adductor pollicis
- Instead the thumb will flex at the interphalangeal joint due to the action of flexor pollicis longus, which is supplied by the anterior interosseous branch of the median nerve.

### Q124
A 35-year-old man attends A&E with acute, severe pain in the right calf. He finds it difficult to walk, and cannot plantar-flex his right foot.
#### Answer: B. Froment's test - *FALSE* = E. Simmonds' test
- The most likely diagnosis in this instance is an Achilles’ tendon rupture
- Simmonds’ test involves asking the patient to kneel facing away from you
- Squeezing the calf should produce plantar flexion at the ankle joint
	- Lack of plantar flexion is indicative of an Achilles’ tendon rupture

### Q125
A 32-year-old man presents with haematuria. A KUB X-ray reveals a staghorn calculus in the right kidney and a mid-stream urine sample grows proteus.
#### Answer: B. Calcium oxalate - *FALSE* = C. Calcium phosphate
- Staghorn calculi form in strongly alkaline urine
	- Associated with UTI with urease-forming bacteria such as Proteus
	- Composed of magnesium ammonium *phosphate* with *calcium*

### Q126
A 31-year-old woman with known sickle cell anaemia attends A&E with biliary colic. X-rays show the presence of stones in the gallbladder.
#### Answer: A. Bile pigment stone - TRUE
- Only 10% of gallstones are radio-opaque
	- Tend to be composed of *calcium bilirubinate*
- Associated with chronic haemolytic disease causing excess bilirubin release

### Q127
A 28-year-old man presents with ureteric colic. A KUB study shows a stone at the right vesico-ureteric junction.
#### Answer: F. Urate - *FALSE* = B. Calcium oxalate
- Calcium oxalate is the most common substance in urinary tract calculi
	- Accounting for approximately 75% of cases

	G. Rodent ulcer
	H. Venous ulcer

### Q128
A 43-year-old man is admitted to the ICU following an RTA. He has been unconscious and intubated since having a *subdural haematoma* evacuated. On day 4 of his admission he begins to have blood aspirated from his nasogastric tube.
#### Answer: D. Duodenal ulcer - *FALSE* = C. Cushing's ulcer
- Cushing's ulcer is a stress ulcer which occurs secondary to head injury

### Q129
A 76-year-old woman presents to clinic with a large ulcer over her medial malleolus. She has recently noticed that it has grown and bleeds more easily. On examination it has a friable centre and raised edges.
#### Answer: H. Venous ulcer - *FALSE* = F. Marjolin's ulcer
- Recent changes, increased vascularity and rolled edges, suggest malignant change
- Squamous cell carcinoma in a chronic venous ulcer is known as a Marjolin's ulcer

### Q130
An 84-year-old man presents with a small ulcer on the bridge of his nose. It has been present for a number of months. On examination it has *pearly white*, rolled edges.
#### Answer: F. Marjolin's ulcer - *FALSE* = G. Rodent ulcer
- Rodent ulcers (aka basal cell carcinomas): arise on sun-exposed areas of skin
- Classically have *raised edges* with a *pearly white* appearance

### Q131
A 24-year-old has 24% third-degree burns. Three days after his admission he complains of melaena.

### Q132
A 40-year-old woman presents with a lump on the anterior aspect of the leg. It has been slowly growing over the past 3 years and is now causing cosmetic disfigurement. On examination you find a 1-cm smooth, firm disc.
#### Answer: B. Dermatofibroma - TRUE
- This has all the characteristics of a benign lesion (slow growing, smooth and small)
- It is a dermatofibroma (also known as histiocytoma)
- A dermatofibroma usually occurs on a limb in middle-aged people
- It starts as a hemispherical lump which flattens into a disc
- It is usually covered by normal-looking skin and has no associated features

### Q133
A 2-year-old child is brought to clinic with a small 1-cm lump in her hairline. The lump has been present since birth, but recently it has begun to bleed. On examination the lump is sessile, dark red and has a small ulcerated area in its centre.
#### Answer: H. Strawberry naevus - TRUE
- Strawberry naevi are present from birth
- They are usually sessile hemispheres, but as they grow they can become pedunculated 
- They are compressible but not pulsatile and most common on the head and neck
	- They can bleed and become ulcerated if knocked

### Q134
A 76-year-old woman presents with a lesion on her left cheek. There is a small ulcer with a *raised pearly edge*. She reports that it has been scabbing over, with the scab falling off every now and then.
#### Answer: A. Basal cell carcinoma - TRUE 
- This is a rodent ulcer or basal cell carcinoma (BCC) 
	- It is locally invasive, but rarely metastasises
- The incidence increases with age as it is related to ultraviolet light exposure
- For the same reason it most commonly occurs on the face
	- Above a line drawn from the angle of the mouth to the Lobe of Ear
- The raised pearly edge is characteristic

### Q135
A 31-year-old man presents with a mole on his right shoulder. It has grown over the past 2 months and is very itchy. It bleeds occasionally. On examination there is a 2-cm, irregular mole on the shoulder with a surrounding brown halo. He is also jaundiced.
#### Answer: D. Melanoma - TRUE
- This is a melanoma
- By definition there is no benign melanoma and the presence of a brown halo and jaundice indicates metastatic spread
- The majority develop in people between 20 and 30 years of age, and they are more common in whites
	- They often itch but are rarely painful

### Q136
A 28-year-old man presents with a lump on the dorsum of his left hand. The lump has grown rapidly over the past 2 weeks. It bleeds easily and is discharging serous fluid. He gives a history of minor trauma to the same hand 3 weeks before. The lump is not painful. On examination there is a bright-red, soft, 1-cm hemispherical lump present.
#### Answer: E. Pyoderma gangrenosum - *FALSE* = F. Pyogenic granuloma
- Pyogenic granulomas are an overgrowth of granulation tissue and usually form after a minor insult such as a scratch or small cut
- They are most common on the hands and face
- They grow rapidly but rarely to more than 1 cm as they outgrow their blood supply

### Q137
A 64-year-old woman presents with a non-painful lump on her left arm. It has grown rapidly over the past 2 weeks. On examination it is approximately 2 cm in diameter and has a central brown core. It is firm in consistency, but the central core is hard.
#### Answer: C. Keratoacanthoma - TRUE
- A keratoacanthoma is a self-limiting overgrowth of a hair follicle
- Central plug is made up of keratin, and it usually presents as a rapidly growing lump that may begin to regress by the time the person attends clinic
- The lump is generally confined to the skin and is mobile over subcutaneous tissue
- It can be mistaken for a squamous cell carcinoma due to its rapid growth


Q138-142: Theme: Airway Management

	H. Single-lumen uncuffed endotracheal tube

### Q138
A 7-year-old child is brought in to A&E having been rescued from a house fire. He is in respiratory distress and there is evidence of soot around his nasal passages.
#### Answer: C. Nasopharyngeal airway - *FALSE* = H. Single-lumen uncuffed endotracheal tube
- The soot in the nasal passages and the respiratory distress suggest a smoke inhalation injury
- Early intubation is recommended
- **NOTE** uncuffed tubes are used in children to minimise chance of tracheal damage

### Q139
A 64-year-old man due to undergo elective repair of a thoracic aortic aneurysm.
#### Answer: B. Double-lumen cuffed endotracheal tube - TRUE
- A general anaesthetic will be required, hence a definitive airway with endotracheal intubation
- A double-lumen tube is used in thoracic surgery so that one lung can be deflated, allowing better access to the chest

### Q140
You are the only doctor in the A&E department. A patient with severe facial injuries suffered in an RTA is brought in by paramedics. He goes into respiratory arrest and an initial attempt at endotracheal intubation fails.
#### Answer: D. Needle cricothyroidotomy - TRUE
- It is likely that there is an airway obstruction, and as this man is in respiratory arrest, urgent intervention is required
- Percutaneous tracheostomy is time-consuming so needle cricothyroidotomy should be attempted
- This is a temporising measure and will allow sufficient ventilation for approximately 30 minutes.

### Q141
A 76-year-old man is on the ICU following emergency laparotomy. He is expected to remain there for another week.
#### Answer: G. Single-lumen cuffed endotracheal tube - *FALSE* = F. Percutaneous tracheostomy
- Tracheostomy reduces the work of breathing, which improves the chances of weaning the patient from mechanical ventilation
- It is also better tolerated and leads to a reduction in inotropes or vasopressors

### Q142
A 27-year-old man involved in a house fire is brought to A&E. He has some singeing of his nasal hair. His RR is 28 breaths/min, and pulse oximetry gives a reading of 94% on 4 l/min oxygen.
#### Answer: H. Single-lumen uncuffed endotracheal tube - *FALSE* = G. Single-lumen cuffed endotracheal tube
- This man again has evidence of smoke inhalation with his nasal hair singeing
- A high respiratory rate and reduced oxygen saturation indicate respiratory distress, and as such he requires endotracheal intubation
- A single-lumen cuffed tube is most commonly used


Q143-151: Theme: Colorectal Carcinoma Procedures
------------------------------------------------

	A. Abdomino-perineal resection (APR)
	B. Anterior resection
	C. Delorme's procedure

	F. Right hemicolectomy
	G. Sigmoid colectomy

### Q143
A patient with carcinoma of the sigmoid colon presenting with peritonitis due to a perforation.
#### Answer: E. Hartmann's procedure - TRUE
- In the acute setting with a patient who has the potential to become extremely unwell through peritonitis, a quick and safe operation is required
- Hartmann's procedure involves forming a colostomy and excising the rectum
	- Oversewing the distal end
- There is a possibility of reversal once the patient has sufficiently recovered

### Q144
A 68-year-old man presents with rectal bleeding. Colonoscopy reveals a caecal tumour.
#### Answer: F. Right hemicolectomy - TRUE
- A right hemicolectomy is performed to excise the tumour and the colon 
	- which has the same blood supply from the superior mesenteric artery

### Q145
A 76-year-old woman presents with rectal bleeding. Digital rectal examination reveals a tumour 2 cm from the anal margin. This is confirmed by proctoscopy.
#### Answer: A. Abdomino-perineal resection (APR) - TRUE
- This is a low rectal tumour and for complete excision it would be hazardous and difficult to maintain the sphincter mechanism
- Abdomino-perineal resection is the operation of choice, and in this procedure the colon and rectum are excised from the intraperitoneal and perineal ends

### Q146
A 54-year-old woman presents with acute appendicitis. A tumour is found in the appendix at appendicectomy.
#### Answer: F. Right hemicolectomy - TRUE
- Appendiceal carcinoma is an indication for right hemicolectomy

### Q147
A 64-year-old man presents with small-bowel obstruction. He gives a 2-month history of a weight loss of 12 kg (2 stone) and intermittent rectal bleeding.
#### Answer: D. Extended right hemicolectomy - *FALSE* = F. Right hemicolectomy
- This is a good story of presentation of a caecal tumour
	- Right hemicolectomy should be performed

### Q148
An 88-year-old man is found to have a 2-cm tumour of the sigmoid colon. His past medical history includes diabetes mellitus, two episodes of *myocardial infarction* and *peripheral vascular disease*.
#### Answer: G. Sigmoid colectomy - *FALSE* = E. Hartmann's procedure
- Although anterior resection is possible, in this instance, with the comorbidities present, a quick operation is essential and it would be better to avoid anastomoses
	- Hartmann's procedure is therefore the procedure of choice

### Q149
A 77-year-old woman presents with a tumour of the transverse colon, 2 cm from the splenic flexure, which is not causing obstruction; there are no metastases.
#### Answer: D. Extended right hemicolectomy - TRUE
- Location of tumour requires greater resection than a standard right hemicolectomy 

### Q150
A 45-year-old man with a non-obtructing *tumour of the sigmoid colon* without metastases.
#### Answer: G. Sigmoid colectomy - TRUE
- This sigmoid lesion requires sigmoid colectomy

### Q151
A 66-year-old man presents with altered bowel habit and he is found to have a tumour approximately 12 cm from the anus. There is no obstruction and there are no metastases.
#### Answer: B. Anterior resection - TRUE
- Non-obstructing, high rectal tumours are suitable for anterior resection

#### Answer: E. Septic arthritis - TRUE
- The child is septic, with raised inflammatory markers
- Dx is septic arthritis of his right hip and he needs a washout of the hip

### Q153
A 14-year-old boy presents with a limp to the right-hand side. There is no history of trauma. He complains of pain around his right knee, and painful movements of the right knee and hip. He appears small for his age, and has no pubertal hair. On examination he has a full although painful range of movement in his right knee. Movements of the right hip are painful and internal rotation is restricted by 20 degrees.
#### Answer: F. Slipped upper femoral epiphysis (SUFE) - TRUE
- SUFE is associated with hypogonadism and is said to occur in short-statured children
	- It is more common in males
- The most common examination finding is restricted internal rotation

An 18-month-old girl with a limp is referred by her general practitioner. She has just started walking. She is otherwise fit and well, and is up to date with all her vaccinations. Perinatal history includes breech delivery and the parents report a club foot which was treated by physiotherapists when she was a neonate.
#### Answer: A. Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) - TRUE
- Common pathologies at this age include septic arthritis, DDH and irritable hip
- Although babies are screened for DDH, as well as some still present at a later age
- It is more common in females, associated with congenital foot abnormalities and breech deliveries as well as with first-born children and multiple deliveries

### Q155
A 4-year-old boy presents with vague pain in the left hip and thigh. Examination reveals a reduced range of internal rotation and abduction. X-rays show flattening and deformity of the femoral head.
#### Answer: D. Perthes’ disease - TRUE
- Perthes’ disease is avascular necrosis of the femoral head
	- which is most commonly seen in boys aged 5–7 years
- The radiological changes are usually well established at presentation


Q156-158: Theme: Sterilisation
------------------------------

	A. Glutaraldehyde 2%
	B. Hot air sterilisation 160°C for 2 hours
	C. Irradiation

### Q156
Sterilisation of a minor instrument set.
#### Answer: D. Steam sterilisation – 15 minutes at 121°C - TRUE
- Autoclaving or steam sterilisation is most often used to sterilise surgical instruments 
- Autoclaves operate at either a cycle of 
	1. 121°C for 15 minutes, or
	2. 134°C for 3 minutes
- This is effective against bacteria, spores and viruses

### Q157
Sterilisation of a colonoscope.
#### Answer: A. Glutaraldehyde 2% - TRUE
- Colonoscopes require fast turnaround times and repeated use
	- 2% glutaraldehyde is used as it is cheap, efficient, fast and easy to use

### Q158
Sterilisation of a single-use stapling gun.
#### Answer: C. Irradiation - TRUE
- Single-use items, commercially produced are usually irradiated for sterilisation
- This is effective and efficient for large-scale use


Q159-162: Theme: Consent
------------------------

	A. Accept wishes for non-treatment
	B. Obtain consent from next of kin
	C. Proceed to treat without consent of patient
	D. Section under Mental Health Act to treat
	E. Seek second opinion
	F. Requires order from court of law to treat

### Q159
A 43-year-old man with *chronic depression* attends with sudden-onset abdominal pain. He is peritonitic and has air under his diaphragm. Your consultant has asked you to obtain consent for a laparotomy. The *patient refuses* and states he would rather die.
#### Answer: C. Proceed to treat without consent of patient - *FALSE* = A. Accept wishes for non-treatment
- Although this man has a chronic mental health problem, he still retains the capacity to make an informed decision about his treatment
- He understands that he is likely to die without surgery and his wishes must be respected
- Although you may be able to section him under the Mental Health Act
	- this only allows for treatment of his mental health problem
	- **not** for treating the intra-abdominal perforation

### Q160
A 13-year-old has an off-ended distal radial and ulna fracture. On examination she has signs of median nerve compromise. You have spoken with both the girl and her mother and informed them that an operation is necessary. The mother is happy to proceed. The child is adamant that she does not wish to have an operation even though she might not regain full use of her hand.
#### Answer: B. Obtain consent from next of kin - *FALSE* = C. Proceed to treat without consent of patient
- A 13-year-old may be ‘Gillick competent’ in that if he or she understands the implications and possible complications of treatment, they may consent to that treatment without the express permission of their parents
- However, in this instance the child would not be allowed to refuse treatment, as this is *not covered* by Gillick competence
- Parental consent has been obtained
	- you can proceed to treat without the consent of the child

### Q161
An 84-year-old with known multi-infarct *dementia* has a fractured neck of femur. He keeps shouting that he wants to be left alone to die.
#### Answer: D. Section under Mental Health Act to treat - *FALSE* = C. Proceed to treat without consent of patient
- This patient has known dementia and so does not have the capacity to make an informed decision with regard to treatment options
- To proceed to operative treatment of the fracture would be to act in the patient's best interests.

### Q162
A 64-year-old man is brought into A&E unconscious. He is thought to have a perforated peptic ulcer secondary to NSAID use. He is known to have metastatic carcinoma of the prostate. His wife attends with an advance directive stating that he does not wish any form of surgery or resuscitation.
#### Answer: A. Accept wishes for non-treatment - TRUE
- A signed, witnessed advance directive must be respected
- As such, even though the current situation does not relate to the probable cause for the advance directive, the patient's wishes must be respected.


Q163-166: Theme: Urological Investigations

	F. Transrectal ultrasound
	G. Uroflowmetry
	H. Video urodynamics

### Q163
A 64-year-old man is referred by his general practitioner with a PSA of 11.0 ng/ml. DRE reveals a 50-g craggy-feeling prostate.
#### Answer: F. Transrectal ultrasound - TRUE
- A raised PSA (upper limit at this age of around 4.5) and a craggy prostate are suspicious of malignancy
- Transrectal ultrasound is the imaging of choice, as CT and MRI have not been shown to reliably demonstrate the prostate
- It is also imperative to obtain tissue to confirm Dx and to stage tumour
	- this can be attempted at the time of the ultrasound

### Q164
A 84-year-old man with known metastatic carcinoma of the prostate attends A&E. He is complaining of abdominal pain and has not passed urine in 18 hours. Clinical examination reveals a tender abdomen, with increased tenderness around the renal angles. DRE reveals a 50-g craggy prostate. He is catheterised and has a residual volume of 35 ml.
#### Answer: B. CT Scan - *FALSE* = A. Abdominal ultrasound
- This man is not producing urine
- He has been catheterised adequately, as some urine was obtained, so he must be either dehydrated or have bilateral ureteric obstruction
- Pelvic lymphadenopathy from metastatic carcinoma of the prostate does cause this
	- an urgent ultrasound scan is indicated to see whether there is any hydronephrosis

### Q165
A 46-year-old man presents with a single episode of haematuria. Flexible cystoscopy is performed in clinic, revealing normal-looking bladder and urethral mucosa.
#### Answer: A. Abdominal ultrasound - TRUE
- Transabdominal US is radiological investigation of choice for frank haematuria
	1. Safe
	2. Non-invasive
	3. Good at differentiating solid and cystic masses

### Q166
A 17-year-old boy presents with a left-sided scrotal swelling. A scrotal ultrasound reveals a varicocele.
#### Answer: C. Intravenous urography - *FALSE* = A. Abdominal ultrasound
- Left testicular vein drains into Left renal vein
	- whereas Right testicular vein drains directly into inferior vena cava
- Left-sided varicocele raises possibility of left renal vein thrombus
	- Commonly caused by left-sided renal tumours
- Abdominal ultrasound scan is first-line investigation


Q167-169: Theme: Arterial Blood Gases (ABGs)
--------------------------------------------

	A. Compensated metabolic acidosis
	B. Compensated metabolic alkalosis
	C. Compensated respiratory acidosis
	D. Compensated respiratory alkalosis
	E. Metabolic acidosis
	F. Metabolic alkalosis
	G. Respiratory acidosis
	H. Respiratory alkalosis

### Q167
A 28-year-old woman with acute pancreatitis presents with severe epigastric pain and vomiting. Her blood gases are: pH 7.5; Pa(O2)13.9 kPa; Pa(CO2) 5 kPa; and bicarbonate 33 mmol/l.
#### Answer: F. Metabolic alkalosis - TRUE
- Metabolic alkalosis: there is a raised pH with increased bicarbonate and a normal Pa(CO2)
- The normal Pa(O2) indicates that the respiratory system has not begun to compensate
	- This situation has arisen due to fluid loss caused by vomiting

### Q168
A 52-year-old *diabetic patient* attends pre-admission clinic. He appears to be short of breath. His blood gases are: pH 7.31; Pa(O2) 14.8 kPa; Pa(CO2) 3 kPa; and bicarbonate 18 mmol/l.
#### Answer: E. Metabolic acidosis - *FALSE* = A. Compensated metabolic acidosis
- Compensated metabolic acidosis: the pH is reduced with decreased bicarbonate
- The respiratory compensation lowers the Pa(CO2) and increases the Pa(O2)
- This patient has diabetic nephropathy, the chronic nature of which has allowed compensation by the respiratory system.

### Q169
A 64-year-old patient in the ICU on her first post-op day following an open aortic aneurysm repair. Her blood gases are: pH 7.31; Pa(O2) 6.6 kPa; Pa(CO2) 7.25 kPa; and bicarbonate 24 mmol/l.
#### Answer: G. Respiratory acidosis - TRUE
- Respiratory acidosis: reduced pH with raised Pa(CO2) and normal bicarbonate
	- In this situation over-sedation is a possible cause
- Poor respiratory effort has caused a reduction in her Pa(O2)


Q170-173: Theme: Obstructive Jaundice
-------------------------------------

	A. Acute pancreatitis
	B. Biliary colic
	C. Carcinoma of the pancreas
	D. Cholangiocarcinoma
	E. Cholecystitis
	F. Chronic pancreatitis
	G. Sclerosing cholangitis
 
### Q170
A 72-year-old woman presents with jaundice and RUQ pain. On examination she has a *palpable mass* in the RUQ. Ultrasound scan of the abdomen reveals dilated ducts, but no gallstones are seen.
#### Answer: E. Cholecystitis - *FALSE* = C. Carcinoma of the pancreas
- In the presence of jaundice with a palpable gallbladder, the cause of the obstruction is unlikely to be stone disease and more likely to be a malignancy
- In addition, the dilatation of the bile ducts with no visible stone disease supports this diagnosis
- Ultrasound does not pick up all pancreatic tumours; CT scanning is more sensitive

### Q171
A 43-year-old presents with a 2-week history of jaundice and steatorrhoea. He has a long-term history of ulcerative colitis, which is treated currently with azathioprine.
#### Answer: G. Sclerosing cholangitis - TRUE
- The steatorrhoea and jaundice are consistent with obstructive jaundice
- Sclerosing cholangitis is associated with inflammatory bowel disease
	- in particular ulcerative colitis
	- which co-exists in 70% of patients

### Q172
A 56-year-old alcoholic presents with jaundice and recurrent episodes of severe epigastric pain radiating to the back. Liver function tests show: bilirubin 143 μmol/l, alkaline phosphatase 750 IU/l, aspartate aminotransferase 378 IU/l, gamma-glutaryl transferase 1106 IU/l. Her amylase is 121 IU/l.
#### Answer: F. Chronic pancreatitis - TRUE
- The history is typical of pancreatitis, and the recurrent episodes suggest the chronic nature of the disease
- In severe cases of chronic pancreatitis
	- serum amylase does **not** necessarily rise
	- as cells producing amylase are destroyed by disease process

### Q173
A 33-year-old woman presents to A&E with severe RUQ pain. The pain has been coming and going for the past 2 hours. Full blood count, urea and electrolytes and liver function test results are all normal. On the consultant ward round the next morning her pain has gone and she wishes to go home.
#### Answer: B. Biliary colic - TRUE
- Hx is typical of biliary colic
	- Pain settles as stone is passed and obstruction is relieved


Q174-176: Theme: Staging of Tumours
-----------------------------------

	A. Ann Arbor staging
	B. Breslow's staging
	C. Clark's staging
	D. Duke's staging
	E. Gleason's score
	F. Manchester staging

### Q174
An excised melanoma found to have a maximum depth of invasion of 6 mm.
#### Answer: C. Clark's staging - *FALSE* = B. Breslow's staging
- There are two staging systems for melanomas: 
	- Clark's staging is defined by invasion of anatomical layers of the skin
	- Breslow's staging is based on the depth of invasion
- We only know depth of invasion: Breslow's is used

### Q175
A 24-year-old presents with a palpable lymph node in the anterior triangle of the neck. Fine-needle aspiration shows the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells.
#### Answer: F. Manchester staging - *FALSE* = A. Ann Arbor staging
- Presence of Reed–Sternberg cells indicates Hodgkin's lymphoma
- This is staged using the Ann Arbor staging system

### Q176
A 73-year-old man presents with PSA of 17.6 ng/ml. A transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy is performed.
#### Answer: E. Gleason's score - TRUE
- Prostate carcinoma is staged using Gleason's scoring system


Q177-180: Theme: Lower Limb Neuropathy
--------------------------------------

	A. Common peroneal nerve
	B. Deep peroneal nerve
	C. Saphenous nerve
	D. Sciatic nerve
	E. Superficial peroneal nerve
	F. Sural nerve
	G. Tibial nerve

### Q177
A 24-year-old woman was in a below-knee plaster cast for 6 weeks to immobilise a fracture of the distal fibula. On removal of the cast after 6 weeks, she is unable to dorsiflex or evert has no sensation on the dorsum of her foot up to the second interdigital cleft.
#### Answer: A. Common peroneal nerve - TRUE
- Common peroneal nerve is in danger of compression when applying below-knee casts
- It is vulnerable around the neck of the fibula
- Both branches of the peroneal nerve are therefore affected, compromising 
	1. **D**orsiflexion (**d**eep peroneal nerve)
	2. Eversion (superficial peroneal nerve)

### Q178
A 37-year-old woman reattends clinic following treatment of her short saphenous vein varicosities by multiple stab avulsions. She is complaining of numbness along the lateral border of the foot.
#### Answer: F. Sural nerve - TRUE
- The sural nerve is a cutaneous sensory branch of the tibial nerve
- It runs just posterior to the short saphenous vein in the leg
	- so is vulnerable to damage during avulsion of this vein

### Q179
A 24-year-old man is involved in an RTA. He has a fracture dislocation of the left hip. Following reduction and internal fixation, he is unable to plantar-flex or dorsiflex his foot. He has no sensation below the knee except for the medial aspect of his leg and the upper medial calf.
#### Answer: G. Tibial nerve - *FALSE* = D. Sciatic nerve
- The sciatic nerve is particularly vulnerable in fracture dislocations of the hip
	- Damage to the nerve has been reported in up to 16% of cases
- The quadriceps is spared as it is supplied by the femoral nerve, and its cutaneous branch, the saphenous nerve, supplies sensation to the upper calf and medial aspect of the leg.

### Q180
A 69-year-old diabetic man complains of numbness around the medial aspect of the leg following femoro-popliteal bypass grafting using a reversed vein graft.
#### Answer: C. Saphenous nerve - TRUE
- The long saphenous vein is the most commonly used vein for vein grafting procedures
- The saphenous nerve runs in close proximity to the vein, supplying the upper calf and medial aspect of the leg
- It is vulnerable to damage when the vein is stripped, particularly if it is stripped below the knee.
