Q1-5: Theme: Diathermy
----------------------

	A. Monopolar diathermy
	B. Bipolar diathermy 
	C. Cutting
	D. Coagulation
	E. Blend

- Bk1: 3076

### Q1

### Q4
Safe for use on digits.
#### Answer: B. Bipolar diathermy - TRUE

### Q5

#### Answer: A. Monopolar diathermy - TRUE

### Notes

#### Monopolar Diathermy
- Works with a high-power unit (400 W)
	- Passing current from the active electrode through the patient to the patient electrode and back to the generator
	- It can be used for cutting and buzzing

#### Bipolar Diathermy
- Works with a low-power unit (50 W)
	- Passing current between the tips of the forcepts
	- Safer to use in patients with pacemakers and on end-arteries in the extremities
		- e.g Digits, Scrotum, Penis
- It **cannot** be used for cutting or buzzing

#### Cutting vs. Coagulation vs. Blend Diathermy
- Cutting: works with a continuous output
- Coagulation: with a pulsed, short high-frequency output
- Blend: with a combination of the two
