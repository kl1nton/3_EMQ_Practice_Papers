#### Answer: Posterior cord syndrome - *FALSE* = B. Brown-Sequard syndrome
- In this scenario there is hemisection of the cord, resulting in paralysis on the affected side below the lesion, along with loss of proprioception and fine discrimination. Pain and temperature sensation are lost on the opposite side as the spinothalamic tract carries fibres which have decussated at a lower level.

### Q76
A 37-year-old woman falls from a horse. She describes a hyperextension-type injury and is ataxic.
#### Answer: A. Anterior cord syndrome - *FALSE* = E. Posterior cord syndrome
- Hyperextension injuries with fractures of posterior vertebral elements
	- commonly cause posterior cord syndrome
- Posterior columns are affected
	- so proprioception is affected, causing the profound ataxia

### Q77
A 64-year-old man falls down a flight of stairs. He is unable to move his right lower leg and cannot feel sharp instruments on the right leg. He still is able to feel coarse touch. X-rays reveal a compression fracture of T12.
#### Answer: C. Cauda equina - *FALSE* = A. Anterior cord syndrome
- Anterior cord syndrome is common after compression fractures of the vertebral bodies 
- Often damage to the anterior spinal artery
	- Neurological damage is a combination of direct trauma and ischaemic damage

The form of ventilation used to assist a patient's inspiratory effort. It is used to effectively ‘top-up’ a patient's own volume of inspired air.
#### Answer: G. Synchronous intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) - *FALSE* = A. Assisted spontaneous breathing (ASB)
- ASB is a pressure-controlled, flow-cycled mode of ventilation
	- The patient is required to breathe for themselves in this method
- It can be combined with either BIPAP or SIMV 
	- To support spontaneous breaths that occur during these modes of ventilation

### Q89
The most frequently used form of ventilation in theatre. It can be set to pressure- or volume-controlled mode.
#### Answer: C. Continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV) - TRUE
- This is generally reserved for use in operating theatres alone
	- as it is difficult to wean patients using this method of ventilation only
- It operates on either a set volume or a set inspiratory pressure
- **NOTE** There is no active patient interaction

### Q90
The form of ventilation used in spontaneously breathing patients to splint the alveoli and improve respiratory mechanics.
#### Answer: D. Continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) - TRUE
- CPAP is one of the simplest forms of ventilation
	- It uses a face mask and provides a continuous positive pressure
- It improves the compliance of the lungs, thereby reducing work of breathing
- It can also help with opening up collapsed alveoli in cases of atelectasis

### Q91
The form of ventilation used to help wean patients from ventilators. Breaths are synchronised with the patient's respiratory efforts.
#### Answer: A. Assisted spontaneous breathing (ASB) - *FALSE* = G. Synchronous intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV)
- SIMV requires the tidal volume and rate to be set
	- There is also a time set between each breath during which
		- if the patient initiates a spontaneous breath
		- the mandatory breath is synchronised with this
- Allows for patient–machine interactivity and the patient can be effectively weaned by increasing the time between each mandatory breath

- **NOTE** Definitive treatment is with a chest drain

### Q93
A 29-year-old man was involved in an RTA. He was the front seat passenger. He is complaining of severe chest pain. On examination he is tachycardic, with a heart rate of 104 beats/min, an RR of 20 breaths/min and a BP of 140/68 mmHg. On examination he has slightly reduced air entry on the left base, which is also dull to percussion. The trachea is slightly deviated to the right. Chest X-ray shows a small left haemothorax and a widened mediastinum.
#### Answer: H. Pericardiocentesis - *FALSE* = I. Urgent arteriography
- This man may have traumatic aortic rupture
- The widened mediastinum, left haemothorax and deviation of the trachea to the right support this diagnosis
- Although this patient appears stable, it is imperative that further assessment of his aorta is carried out by means of either a CT scan or arteriography
- Patients with aortic injury who have a chance of survival usually have an incomplete laceration near the ligamentum arteriosum of the aorta
- Specific signs are frequently absent and further investigation is warranted if aortic injury is suspected

### Q102
The inotrope used in cardiac arrest situations to provoke ventricular fibrillation.
#### Answer: B. Dobutamine - *FALSE* = A. Adrenaline (*epinephrine*)
- Adrenaline has a propensity to cause arrhythmia
- Thus adrenaline is used in cardiac arrest situations to try to 
	- Convert a non-shockable rhythm to ventricular fibrillation
		- which is susceptible to electrical shock

### Q103
The inotrope that in a low dose (less than 4 μg/kg per min) can be used to increase glomerular filtration rate and sodium excretion.
#### Answer: D. Isoprenaline - *FALSE* = C. Dopamine
- Stimulation of dopaminergic receptors leads to increased renal blood flow
	- hence increased glomerular filtration rate and increased sodium excretion
- However, at higher doses, β1 receptors are also stimulated
	- Causing an increase in heart rate and contractility
- At very high doses (>10 μg/kg per min) dopamine stimulates α1 receptors 
	- Causing reduced tissue perfusion, reducing glomerular filtration rate

#### Answer: G. Nephro-uretectomy - TRUE
- Transitional cell carcinomas of the renal pelvis resemble those affecting the bladder but are much less common
- They tend to invade the renal parenchyma and have a tendency to distal spread
	- There is also a strong tendency for these tumours to be multifocal
- Conventional surgical treatment is by nephro-uretectomy
	- **NOTE** Ureter must be removed with a cuff of bladder wall

### Q144
A 55-year-old woman is found to have widespread carcinoma in situ (CIS) on cystoscopy and biopsy. She is treated initially with several instillations of intravesical BCG. Repeat cystoscopy shows no change in the CIS and urethral biopsy confirms CIS. She is keen to have aggressive treatment.
#### Answer: C. Cystectomy + urethrectomy + ileal conduit - TRUE
- In patients who have primary CIS which is unresponsive to medical management, cystectomy is an option
- Often this is accompanied by urethrectomy as the urethra is often also involved
	- **NOTE** Urine is commonly diverted into an ileal conduit

#### Answer: C. Class III haemorrhagic shock - TRUE

#### Notes
- Reduction of blood volume is associated with physiological responses mainly mediated by the sympathetic nervous system, which aim to maintain blood pressure and hence blood supply to the vital organs
- Haemorrhagic shock can be divided into four classes depending on the amount of blood lost
- Each class is associated with particular parameters which help in the estimation of blood loss

#### Haemorrhagic Shock
- Class I is loss of 0–15% of circulating volume
	- there are no obvious changes apart from the patient perhaps feeling uncomfortable and restless
 - Class II (15–30% loss) is associated with a rise in pulse rate to greater than 100/min, urine output reduced to 20–30 ml/h and a raised RR of 20–30 breaths/min
	- The BP is normal but pulse pressure is reduced
- Class III (30–40% loss) is associated with a tachycardia of >120/min, reduction in both pulse pressure and BP and reduction in urine output to 10 –20 ml/h
 
- In Class IV (> 40% blood loss) the patient becomes anxious and may be confused
	- There is tachycardia of >130/min, BP and pulse pressure are low and the patient is anuric
	- The RR is over 40 breaths/min

#### Answer:  F. Subtotal thyroidectomy - *FALSE* = D. Propylthiouracil
- First-line treatment for Graves’ disease is carbimazole
- In certain individuals it has the unfortunate side effect of agranulocytosis
	- So propylthiouracil is used instead

### Q149
A 36-year-old woman is in her second trimester of pregnancy. She was mildly thyrotoxic at first but is increasingly symptomatic and requires treatment.
#### Answer: D. Propylthiouracil - TRUE
- Propylthiouracil is also the drug of choice in pregnancy as it is protein-bound 
	- Therefore less likely to cross the placenta

### Q150
A 56-year-old woman diagnosed with toxic multinodular goitre which is unresponsive to medical treatment.
#### Answer: E. Radio-iodine ablation - TRUE
- Radio-iodide ablation is safe for patients in

### Q152
A 20-year-old woman presents with complaints of dark-coloured urine, pale stools and *weight loss* for a few weeks. On examination she has *painless jaundice*.
#### Answer: A. Carcinoma of the head of the pancreas - TRUE
- Painless jaundice together with a history of weight loss is strongly suggestive of a malignancy
- Together with an obstructive picture (*pale stools and dark urine*)
	- Carcinoma of the head of the pancreas is the most likely diagnosis

### Q153
A 10-year-old boy with known sickle cell disease presents with pain in the *epigastric* region. On examination he has *jaundice*.
#### Answer: D. Haemolytic anaemia - *FALSE* = B. Gallstones
- Jaundice in children with sickle cell disease can be due to red cell haemolysis
- However, coupled with episodes of epigastric pain and an obstructive picture
	- Most likely diagnosis is gallstone obstruction of the common bile duct 
		- as pigment bile stones are common

### Q154
A known intravenous drug misuser with a history of hepatitis B presents with jaundice and loss of weight. Blood tests reveal raised α-fetoprotein. He admits sharing needles with other drug misusers.
#### Answer: F. Primary liver carcinoma - TRUE
- Sharing of needles among intravenous drug misusers is a serious risk factor for hepatitis B and C
	- both of which predispose to the development of hepatocellular cancer in later years
- Alpha-fetoprotein is a marker for this cancer, although it is also raised in hepatoma

### Q155
A 35-year-old rugby player twists his knee during a match. It gradually swells and becomes tender, and he finds himself unable to fully extend it. It is tender over the medial joint line. An X-ray shows evidence of an effusion. Despite aspiration of the traumatic effusion, he is still unable to fully extend the knee.
#### Answer: D. Medial meniscus tear - TRUE
- *Tenderness over joint line* following an *acute injury* is most likely due to a meniscal injury rather than a collateral ligament
- Bucket-handle tears of menisci can result in positioning of the torn meniscus between the articular surfaces preventing full extension of the knee

### Q156
A 25-year-old footballer *hyperextends* his knee while attempting to kick the ball. He hears a loud ‘popping’ sound. The knee swells up immediately. In the following weeks his knee is painful on weight-bearing and gives way without warning.
#### Answer: F. Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) tear - *FALSE* = A. Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear
- Anterior cruciate ligament tears result in rapid swelling of the affected knee
- This is because the ligament is intra-articular and haemarthrosis can follow a tear
- **NOTE** Hyperextension is a classic mechanism by which ACL tears occur

	- Such patients can be managed by surveillance alone (digital rectal examination (DRE) and regular prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurements) 
	- With further management when they become symptomatic or when PSA level rises
- Radical prostatectomy is usually only offered to those with a life expectancy of > 10 years
	- Associated with a relatively high level of impotence and incontinence when compared with other treatments

### Q158
A 50-year-old man with pT2 prostate cancer diagnosed on rectal biopsy wants curative treatment. He is sexually active and wants to have a minimal chance of developing incontinence and impotence, and wants to reduce the amount of time spent in hospital. He has a small-volume prostate.
#### Answer: A. Androgen ablation - *FALSE* = B. Brachytherapy
- Localised disease can also be treated with 
	1. radiotherapy in the form of external beam radiotherapy, which requires the patient to attend hospital on a daily basis for 4–6 weeks, or 
	2. brachytherapy, which involves the implantation of radioactive seeds into the prostate
- For this treatment the prostate must be less than 50–60 grams as the pubic arch can prevent implantation
- T3 and T4 (locally advanced and metastatic disease) can be treated with hormone manipulation using luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist, anti-androgens or orchidectomy.

### Q159
A 65-year-old man was diagnosed as having prostate cancer with lung and bony metastases and local invasion. He was treated with androgen ablation for 6 months but is now complaining of increasing bony and pelvic pain.
#### Answer: D. Radical prostatectomy - *FALSE* = C. External beam radiotherapy
- Radiotherapy can be used for symptomatic metastasis and hormone-relapsed cancer


Q160-162: Theme: Management of Ankle Injuries

- Bk1: 20831

### Q160
A 46-year-old woman stumbles on a pavement kerb, landing awkwardly on her left ankle. She is unable to weight bear. An X-ray shows a fracture of the *lateral malleolus only*.
#### Answer: B. Closed reduction and plaster of Paris - TRUE
- If an ankle fracture is stable (ie one malleolus affected or no talar shift)
	- it can be managed perfectly well by closed reduction and plaster cast

### Q161
A 34-year-old footballer has an eversion injury to the right ankle, resulting in an avulsion fracture of the medial malleolus. An X-ray also shows an undisplaced fracture of the fibula at the junction between the middle and lower thirds of the shaft.
#### Answer: C. Open reduction and internal fixation - TRUE
- Unstable fractures (ie those with talar shift, potential for talar shift or associated fibular fracture extending above the tibial plafond) 
	- Require open reduction and internal fixation

### Q162
A 29-year-old woman stumbles while running for the bus, landing heavily on her left ankle. The ankle becomes swollen over the lateral aspect and she has difficulty weight-bearing. An X-ray shows *no fracture*.
#### Answer: D. Strict non-weight-bearing and physiotherapy only - *FALSE* = E. Support, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and early mobilisation
- Ankle sprains should be 
	1. Managed conservatively with analgesia, with or without strapping
	2. Patient should be encouraged to move the ankle and weight-bear

- Bk1: 9051

### Q163
A 69-year-old man presents with a caecal mass presumed to be adenocarcinoma. While undergoing staging investigations, he develops right-sided abdominal pain, guarding and rebound in the right iliac fossa (RIF) associated with fever. There is a mild pyrexia and raised white blood cell count.
#### Answer: A. Appendicitis - TRUE
- Appendicitis is a complication of caecal carcinoma due to obstruction of the lumen
- However, an important differential is perforation and formation of a localised abscess 
	- which can present with the same symptoms

### Q164
A 70-year-old man with a *known tumour* of the transverse colon presents with spasms of abdominal pain, abdominal distension and dehydration. A new *sausage-shaped mass* is palpable in the epigastrium.
#### Answer: B. Colocolic intussusception - TRUE
- Intussusception typically presents as in this case and the tumour acts as the apex
- **NOTE** Half of all adult intussusceptions are due to carcinoma

### Q165
A 52-year-old man with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the transverse colon presents with faecal vomiting.
#### Answer: F. Obstruction - *FALSE*
- Direct invasion of a tumour into a neighbouring organ can cause a fistula, eg vesicocolic, rectovaginal or, in the case in the question, fistulation of the transverse colon to the stomach or duodenum

### Q166
A 69-year-old woman presents with paraesthesia, muscle cramps and a tingling sensation around the mouth. She has a past history of thyroidectomy for benign goitre.
#### Answer: C. Hypoparathyroidism - TRUE
- Hypoparathyroidism presents with the symptoms of hypocalcaemia, including 
	- paraesthesia
	- cramps
	- tetany
	- circumoral tingling
	- convulsions
- Although most commonly seen post-operatively owing to damage to the parathyroid glands (eg post-thyroidectomy)
	- hypoparathyroidism is also seen after acute pancreatitis, in chronic renal failure and in vitamin D deficiency

### Q167
A 54-year-old renal dialysis patient is found to have raised serum calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels.
#### Answer: E. Secondary hyperparathyroidism - *FALSE* = F. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism
- Primary hyperparathyroidism is most commonly due to a single parathyroid adenoma causing raised levels of PTH and calcium
- Secondary hyperparathyroidism is caused by chronic renal failure in response to a low calcium level and is characterised by a low serum calcium and a raised PTH level
- Tertiary hyperparathyroidism is also seen in chronic renal failure
	- Due to parathyroid gland becoming hyperplastic and secreting PTH autonomously secondary to long-term stimulation

### Q168
A 47-year-old woman with a history of postural hypotension and pigmentation of the buccal mucosa and skin is admitted as an emergency with abdominal pain and constipation. She had an episode of renal colic 2 weeks ago.
#### Answer: A. Addison's disease - TRUE
- Addison's disease is a rarer cause of hyPERcalcaemia
- Pigmentation of buccal mucosa and postural hypotension are typical features

### Q169
A 60-year-old man, day 1 post-op right shoulder hemiarthroplasty for severe arthritis develops acute urinary retention. He is catheterised and found to have a residual volume of 800 ml. Digital rectal examination (DRE) shows a smooth, benign, moderately sized prostate.
#### Answer: H. Trial without catheter (TWOC) and α-blocker - TRUE
- A recent general anaesthetic and opioid-based analgesia causing constipation are two factors which predispose to developing urinary retention postoperatively
- Success rates of TWOC in these circumstances are improved by starting an α-blocker 48 hours prior to catheter removal.

### Q170
A 65-year-old man has bladder outflow obstruction secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) confirmed by urodynamic studies. Initial success with medical management has been followed by worsening of symptoms, severely affecting his quality of life. DRE reveals a benign-feeling prostate, *50 g in size*. Transrectal ultrasound shows no hypoechogenic areas. The patient is very fit, well and active and will not accept long-term catheterisation.
#### Answer: F. Transurethral incision of prostate - *FALSE* = D. Open prostatectomy
- Symptomatic bladder outflow obstruction secondary to BPH for which medical treatment has failed 
	- Can be treated by surgery – most commonly *TURP or open prostatectomy*
- Morbidity in patients with large prostates is less if they have an open prostatectomy rather than TURP as this 
	- Reduces the operation time
	- Avoids the excess fluid absorption that can occur during prolonged TURP surgery
- Surgery is best avoided in those keen to start a family and remain sexually active, due to the risk of impotence.

### Q171
A 56-year-old man recently remarried and wants to start a family. He has long-standing symptoms of hesitancy, frequency and terminal dribbling. He recently developed occasional haematuria – fully investigated and not found to be due to any other cause than BPH. DRE and ultrasound scan reveal a benign 40-g prostate.
#### Answer: B. Finasteride - TRUE
- Finasteride is effective in treating BPH associated with prostates > 30 g 
	- Has the additional advantage of reducing prostatic bleeding

A patient who has undergone appendicectomy has the sutures removed and the medial 2 cm of the wound opens up, with only a small serous discharge.
#### Answer: F. Wound dehiscence - TRUE
- Opening of one or any of the layers of the wound is called dehiscence

### Q173
A patient who has undergone laparotomy has pink fluid oozing from the wound a day before having the sutures removed. The wound opens and the bowel extrudes.
#### Answer: D. Incisional hernia - *FALSE* = C. Evisceration
- **Evisceration** = complete disruption of all layers of abdominal wall closure
	- Often preceded by a blood-stained watery discharge

### Q174
A patient who is 5 days post-op following appendicectomy develops low-grade pyrexia. The wound is full and very tender, and pressure on the medial aspect causes pus to extrude.
#### Answer: A. Abscess - TRUE
- The low-grade pyrexia, fullness of the wound and purulent exudate with pressure suggest an abscess is more likely than an infection

### Q175
A 1-year-old infant of African origin has had an *umbilical hernia* since birth. He is asymptomatic.
#### Answer: A. Conservative management - TRUE
- **NOTE** Umbilical hernias in young children should be treated conservatively as most resolve spontaneously
- Surgical repair should be reserved for those children in whom the hernia has not resolved by the age of 3 years and the fascial defect is > 1.5 cm in diameter
- They should then undergo a repair similar to the ‘vest over pants’ Mayo repair used for repair of paraumbilical hernias in adults

### Q176
A 38-year-old man presents to the outpatients department with a femoral hernia which is non-tender and with no evidence of strangulation or obstruction. He wants to have it repaired.
#### Answer: C. Mayo's operation 'vest over pants' - *FALSE* = F. Repair via high inguinal (Lotheissen) approach
- Royal College of Surgeons recommends the high inguinal approach for elective repair of *femoral hernias*, except in thin females, where a low crural approach is advised

### Q177
A fit and well 32-year-old man develops bilateral inguinal hernias which are increasing in size and becoming unsightly. He has not had any abdominal surgery previously.
#### Answer: B. Laparoscopic repair - TRUE
- Laparoscopic repair of inguinal hernias is recommended for the management of bilateral inguinal hernias

#### Answer: E. Mitomycin - *FALSE* = G. Rifampicin
- *Tuberculous* UTI present with symptoms of 
	1. recurrent UTIs
	2. weight loss
	3. fever
	4. night sweats
- Mid-stream urine shows *sterile pyuria* (= tuberculosis)
	- It is usually secondary to renal tuberculosis
- It usually responds to antituberculous drugs, but in cases with advanced renal disease, infection may not subside until the involved kidney and ureter have been removed
- **NOTE** Diabetic patients are particularly prone to developing UTIs.

### Q179
A 47-year-old diabetic woman presents with dysuria, frequency and urgency. The urine is cloudy and smells offensive and is positive for nitrites and leucocytes on urine dipstick. She is systemically well.
#### Answer: D. Metronidazole - *FALSE* = F. Oral ciprofloxacin
- If uncomplicated and patient is systemically well: MCC =  *Escherichia coli* 
	- Tx: can be treated with an PO ABx: *ciprofloxacin* or *trimethoprim*

### Q180
A 52-year-old man presents to A&E with a 2-day history of feeling generally unwell. Over the last 12 hours he has developed right loin pain and rigors and has a temperature of 39°C. Urine dipstick is positive for nitrites.
#### Answer: C. Intravenous co-amoxiclav (Augmentin) - TRUE
- Loin pain, fever and evidence of urine infection should alert you to the possibility of *ascending infection* causing pyelonephritis
- Tx: IV co-amoxiclav (*Augmentin*) and hospital admission is required
