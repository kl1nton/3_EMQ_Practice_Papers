#### Answer: F. Crohn's disease - *FALSE* - D. Volvulus (*Sigmoid*)
- Hx of constipation and laxative abuse - linked to &uarr; risk of sigmoid volvulus

### Q2
A 65-year-old man with a 2-month history of *altered bowel habit* and *weight loss* presents with a 2-day history of increasing abdominal distension, pain and *absolute constipation*.
#### Answer: E. Carcinoma - TRUE
- Hx of 
	1. Altered bowel habit, and
	2. Weight loss, associated with 
	3. Obstruction
- Carcinoma *until proved otherwise*

### Q3
A 90-year-old woman *5 days post-op* following a *hemiarthroplasty* of the left hip has increasing *abdominal distension* and *pain* and has *not opened her bowels* for 9 days.
#### Answer: A. Paralytic ileus - TRUE

#### Answer: B. Adhesions - *FALSE* = G. Gallstone ileus
- While previous abdominal surgery predisposes to adhesions
	Past medical history of abdominal pain could represent gallstones
- **NOTE** Finding of air outlining the biliary tree or gallbladder on X-ray

#### Answer: H. CT scan with contrast - *FALSE* = F. Urethrogram
- Patient has blood at the external urethral meatus
	- Urethrography must be *first investigation*, prior to passing a catheter

### Q6
A 45-year-old man involved in an RTA as the *restrained driver* sustains *fractures of ribs 8-12*. He is initially haemodynamically unstable, but responds to fluids. There is *free fluid in the abdomen* on a FAST scan (focused abdominal sonography for trauma) and *frank haematuria* is draining from the catheter.
#### Answer: F. Urethrogram - *FALSE* = H. CT scan with contrast
- Patient is most likely to have a *renal injury*, given level of rib fractures
	- Contrast CT is required in this stable patient (renal injuries = Contrast CT)

### Q8
A 30-year-old motorcyclist sustains an *unstable pelvic fracture*. His catheter is draining *frank haematuria*.
#### Answer: C. Ultrasound scan (USS) - *FALSE* = E. Cystogram
- Bladder trauma is commonly associated with pelvic fractures 
	- **Not well** visualised on CT
- Cystogram is Ix of choice in a case of suspected bladder injury

#### Notes
- Imaging of renal trauma is dependent on the injury suspected
	- **NOTE** Plain X-rays, KUB studies and USS have little or no role to play

##### Intravenous Urogram (IVU)
- IVU can be useful for *renal injuries* - contrast CT is more sensitive and specific 
- IVU **is** used for *ureteric injuries*, unless other injuries are suspected
	- In which case contrast CT can image these as well

##### Urethrogram
- Urethrogram must be performed prior to catheterisation if
	1. Blood is seen at the *external urethral meatus*, or 
	2. There is a *high-riding prostate*

##### Cystogram
- In cases of *suspected bladder injury* a cystogram is investigation of choice

#### Answer: F. Tubercular arthritis - *FALSE* = E. Transient synovitis
- Transient synovitis is a diagnosis of exclusion - *always rule out septic arthritis*
- In this case, transient synovitis is the most likely diagnosis
	- Child is *systemically well*
	- Recent *Hx of viral illness* (and **normal bloods**)

#### Answer: A. Austin-Moore hemiarthroplasty - *FALSE* = E. Thompson's hemiarthroplasty
- Patient requires a hemiarthroplasty as the fracture is displaced intracapsular 
	- Avascular necrosis (AVN) is a significant risk
- Patient does not have significant past medical problems restricting length of GA
	- Cemented (*Thompson's*) hemiarthroplasty would be best choice 

### Q39
A *previously fit and well* *60-year-old* woman fell downstairs, sustaining a *minimally displaced subcapital fracture* of the left neck of femur.
#### Answer: D. Immediate cannulated screws - TRUE
- Patient is *under 65* with

#### Answer: E. Thompson's hemiarthroplasty - *FALSE* = G. Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) w. Gamma Nail
- Undisplaced subcapital # - good chance of maintaining blood supply if there is minimal disruption of capsule
	- They can generally be treated with the insertion of cannulated screws
- *Displaced fracture* (Garden III and IV) - high risk of developing AVN of femoral head
	- Hemiarthroplasty is preferred management
- **NOTE** Exception is young patients - preservation of femoral head is vital 
	- Rather than insertion of a prosthesis at a young age
	- Open reduction and internal fixation is preferable (*Gamma Nail*)

### Q42
A 77-year-old woman trips while shopping, sustaining an *intertrochanteric fracture* of the left neck of femur. There is a 6-cm *subtrochanteric extension*.
#### Answer: F. Total hip replacement (THR) - *FALSE* = G. Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) w. IM Nail
- Subtrochanteric extension of the fracture renders it highly unstable - unsuitable for DHS

### Q48
A patient known to have an AAA, which was 5.3 cm at the previous clinic appointment, has undergone a CT scan. The scan reveals a *5.7-cm infrarenal aneurysm* extending from *0.5 cm below the renal arteries* into both common iliacs.
#### Answer: B. Emergency surgery - *FALSE* = D. Elective open repair
- Gradual increase in size of aneurysm necessitates *elective repair* in a medically fit patient
- *Unsuitable for endoluminal repair* as it is only 0.5 cm below the renal arteries
	- Aneurysm would need to be 2 cm below for endoluminal repair

### Q49
A patient known to have an AAA is reviewed in clinic for the third time. Ultrasound reveals an *increase in size from 4 cm to 4.5 cm*.
#### Answer: F. Ultrasound in 6 months - TRUE
- Aneurysm is asymptomatic + between 4.0 and 5.5 cm = surveillance should be increased to 6-monthly

### Q50
An asymptomatic patient is reviewed in clinic. The ultrasound shows a *5-cm AAA*. A scan taken *6 months before showed a 3.7-cm aneurysm*.
#### Answer: C. Elective endoluminal repair - *FALSE* = E. Urgent elective repair
- Rapid increase in size of more than 1 cm (in 6mo) means that urgent surgery is required
